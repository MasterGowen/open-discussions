    <p>What makes a service business successful? The rule of thumb for many companies in industries like retail,
        hospitality, finance/banking, and health care has been to drive down wages and operating costs, creating a
        vicious cycle of disinvestment in search of higher profits. </p>
    <p><br/>Zeynep Ton, the faculty leader for this course, asked herself, <i>what if the focus shifted</i> …<br/></p>
    <ul>
        <li>from lower labor costs to smarter investments</li>
        <li>from offering infinite variety to creating products and services experiences that customers wanted to buy
        </li>
        <li>from frontline managers who fight fires and execute someone else’s plans to frontline managers who develop
            their employees and improve company performance
        </li>
        <li>from jobs that have high turnover to jobs that people want to keep…</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br/><i>Could organizations hit new standards of excellence and performance? </i></p>
    <p><br/>Grounded in Professor Ton’s research over many years and with multiple people-intensive companies, this
        program is designed to help leaders of service businesses create an organization that delivers superior value to
        customers, shareholders, and employees at the same time. Through a combination of assessments, recent
        interactive case studies, lectures, and videos, participants will learn about the key elements of operational
        excellence in services and how to adapt an integrated set of these strategies in their organization. </p>
    <p><br/>Participants (and a sample of their frontline employees and managers) can complete an assessment survey in
        advance of the program. The course content, combined with the data from the surveys, will help
        participants—especially those who attend as a team—identify key areas for improvement and provide guidance on
        next steps for their organizations. </p>
    <p><br/>The course leverages a systems perspective to frame discussions around key elements of operational
        excellence in services, including: <br/></p>
    <ul>
        <li>What excellence looks like for customers, employees, investors</li>
        <li>Creating a capable and motivated workforce</li>
        <li>Making operational choices that increase productivity and contribution of the workforce and that allow them
            to delight customers
        </li>
        <li>Designing an operating system for continuous improvement A values system that emphasizes customers,
            employees, and continuous improvement
        </li>
    </ul>

        Shareholders, and Employees</i>.) <br/></p>

            Zeynep Ton is Professor of the Practice, Operations Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management.
        <p>
        <p>Ton is currently examining how organizations can design and manage their operations in a way that satisfies
            employees, customers, and investors simultaneously. Her earlier research focused on the critical role of
            store operations in retail supply chains. Ton identified operational problems at stores that reduce retail
            supply chain performance as well as store profits and traced these problems to the design of store processes
            and the management of store labor.
        <p>
        <p>
        <p>Her work has been published in a variety of journals, including <i>Organization Science, Production and
            Operations Management,</i> and <i>Harvard Business Review</i>. In addition, she has written numerous cases
            that explore different approaches to managing retail stores and labor. Prior to MIT Sloan, Ton spent seven
            years as an assistant professor in the Technology and Operations Management area at Harvard Business School,
            where she was awarded the HBS Faculty Teaching Award for teaching excellence.
        <p>
        <p>Ton holds a DBA from Harvard Business School and a BS in Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering from
            Pennsylvania State University.
